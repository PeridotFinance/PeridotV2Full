  const borrowAmount = Number(contractPos.borrowBalance) / 1e18
  // ... mapping logic ready for implementation
}

// Contract calls structure ready
const userPositions = await Promise.all(
  marketAddresses.map(async (market) => {
    const [balance, borrowBalance, exchangeRate] = await Promise.all([
      readContract({ address: market.pTokenAddress, abi: pTokenABI, functionName: 'balanceOf', args: [address] }),
      readContract({ address: market.pTokenAddress, abi: pTokenABI, functionName: 'borrowBalanceStored', args: [address] }),
